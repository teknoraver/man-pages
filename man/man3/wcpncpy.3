.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR wcpncpy ()
function is the wide-character equivalent
of the
.BR stpncpy (3)
function.
It copies at most
.I n
wide characters from the wide-character
string pointed to by
.IR src ,
including the terminating null wide (L\[aq]\[rs]0\[aq]),
to the array pointed to by
.IR dest .
Exactly
.I n
wide characters are
written at
.IR dest .
If the length
.I wcslen(src)
is smaller than
.IR n ,
the remaining wide characters in the array pointed to
by
.I dest
are filled with L\[aq]\[rs]0\[aq] characters.
If the length
.I wcslen(src)
is greater than or equal
to
.IR n ,
the string pointed to by
.I dest
will
not be L\[aq]\[rs]0\[aq] terminated.
.P
The strings may not overlap.
.P
The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least
.I n
wide
characters at
.IR dest .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR wcpncpy ()
returns a pointer to the last wide character written, that is,
.IR dest + n \-1.
