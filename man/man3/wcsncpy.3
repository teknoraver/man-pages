.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wchar.h>
.P
.BI "wchar_t *wcsncpy(size_t " n ;
.BI "                 wchar_t " dest "[restrict " n ],

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR wcsncpy ()
function is the wide-character equivalent of the
.BR strncpy (3)
function.
It copies at most
.I n
wide characters from the wide-character
string pointed to by
.IR src ,
including the terminating null wide character (L\[aq]\[rs]0\[aq]),
to the array pointed to by
.IR dest .
Exactly
.I n
wide characters are
written at
.IR dest .
If the length
.I wcslen(src)
is smaller than
.IR n ,
the remaining wide characters in the array
pointed to by
.I dest
are filled
with null wide characters.
If the length
.I wcslen(src)
is greater than or equal to
.IR n ,
the string pointed to by
.I dest
will not be terminated by a null wide character.
.P
The strings may not overlap.
.P
The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least
.I n
wide
characters at
.IR dest .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR wcsncpy ()
returns
.IR dest .
