.SH DESCRIPTION
Redirect output that would have gone to

to the given terminal.
If that was a pseudoterminal master, send it to the slave.

Only a process with the

capability may do this.
.P
If output was redirected already, then
.B EBUSY
is returned,
but redirection can be stopped by using this ioctl with
.I fd
pointing at
.I /dev/console
or
.IR /dev/tty0 .
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
0 is returned.
On error,
\-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.

.SH HISTORY

was not necessary.
