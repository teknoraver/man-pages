.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

.SH DESCRIPTION
Set the default keyring to which implicitly requested keys
will be linked for this thread, and return the previous setting.
Implicit key requests are those made by internal kernel components,
.\" I.e., calls to the kernel's internal request_key() interface,
.\" which is distinct from the request_key(2) system call (which
.\" ultimately employs the kernel-internal interface).
such as can occur when, for example, opening files
on an AFS or NFS filesystem.
Setting the default keyring also has an effect when requesting
a key from user space; see
.BR request_key (2)
for details.
.P
The
.I op
argument
should contain one of the following values,
to specify the new default keyring:
.TP
.B KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_NO_CHANGE
Don't change the default keyring.
This can be used to discover the current default keyring
(without changing it).
.TP
.B KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_DEFAULT
This selects the default behaviour,
which is to use the thread-specific keyring if there is one,
otherwise the process-specific keyring if there is one,
otherwise the session keyring if there is one,
otherwise the UID-specific session keyring,
otherwise the user-specific keyring.
.TP
.B KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_THREAD_KEYRING
Use the thread-specific keyring
.RB ( thread\-keyring (7))
as the new default keyring.
.TP
.B KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_PROCESS_KEYRING
Use the process-specific keyring
.RB ( process\-keyring (7))
as the new default keyring.
.TP
.B KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_SESSION_KEYRING
Use the session-specific keyring
.RB ( session\-keyring (7))
as the new default keyring.
.TP
.B KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_USER_KEYRING
Use the UID-specific keyring
.RB ( user\-keyring (7))
as the new default keyring.
.TP
.B KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_USER_SESSION_KEYRING
Use the UID-specific session keyring
.RB ( user\-session\-keyring (7))
as the new default keyring.
.TP
.BR KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_REQUESTOR_KEYRING " (since Linux 2.6.29)"
.\" 8bbf4976b59fc9fc2861e79cab7beb3f6d647640
Use the requestor keyring.
.\" FIXME The preceding explanation needs to be expanded.
.\" Is the following correct:
.\"
.\"	The requestor keyring is the dest_keyring that
.\"	was supplied to a call to request_key(2)?
.\"
.\" David Howells said: to be checked
.P
All other values are invalid.
.\" (including the still-unsupported KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_GROUP_KEYRING)
.P
The setting controlled by this operation is inherited by the child of
.BR fork (2)
and preserved across
.BR  execve (2).
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
the ID of the previous default keyring
to which implicitly requested keys were linked
(one of
.BR KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_USER_* ).
.P
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH VERSIONS
A wrapper is provided in the
.I libkeyutils
library:
.BR keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring (3)
.SH STANDARDS
Linux.
.SH HISTORY
Linux 2.6.13.
