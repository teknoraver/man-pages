.SH NAME
/proc/interrupts \- number of interrupts
.SH DESCRIPTION
.TP
.I /proc/interrupts
This is used to record the number of interrupts per CPU per IO device.
Since Linux 2.6.24,
for the i386 and x86-64 architectures, at least, this also includes
interrupts internal to the system (that is, not associated with a device
as such), such as NMI (nonmaskable interrupt), LOC (local timer interrupt),
and for SMP systems, TLB (TLB flush interrupt), RES (rescheduling
interrupt), CAL (remote function call interrupt), and possibly others.
Very easy to read formatting, done in ASCII.
