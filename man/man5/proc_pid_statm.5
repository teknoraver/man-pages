.SH NAME
/proc/pid/statm \- memory usage information
.SH DESCRIPTION
.TP
.IR /proc/ pid /statm
Provides information about memory usage, measured in pages.
The columns are:
.IP
.in +4n
.EX
size       (1) total program size
           (same as VmSize in \f[I]/proc/\f[]pid\f[I]/status\f[])
resident   (2) resident set size
           (inaccurate; same as VmRSS in \f[I]/proc/\f[]pid\f[I]/status\f[])
shared     (3) number of resident shared pages
           (i.e., backed by a file)
           (inaccurate; same as RssFile+RssShmem in
           \f[I]/proc/\f[]pid\f[I]/status\f[])
text       (4) text (code)
.\" (not including libs; broken, includes data segment)
lib        (5) library (unused since Linux 2.6; always 0)
data       (6) data + stack
.\" (including libs; broken, includes library text)
dt         (7) dirty pages (unused since Linux 2.6; always 0)
.EE
.in
.IP
.\" See SPLIT_RSS_COUNTING in the kernel.
.\" Inaccuracy is bounded by TASK_RSS_EVENTS_THRESH.
Some of these values are inaccurate because
of a kernel-internal scalability optimization.
If accurate values are required, use
.IR /proc/ pid /smaps
or
.IR /proc/ pid /smaps_rollup
instead, which are much slower but provide accurate, detailed information.
