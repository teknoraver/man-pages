Name
	patches/patches - instructions for contributing patches

Description
	If you know how to fix a problem in a manual page (if not, see
	<CONTRIBUTING.d/bugs>), then send a patch in an email.

	Configure git(1) for this project.  See <CONTRIBUTING.d/git>.

	Send logically separate patches.  For logically-separate issues,
	send separate emails.  For related issues, send a patch set with
	a cover letter that gives an overview of all of the patches, and
	each patch should be a reply to the cover-letter mail.  We
	recommend using git-format-patch(1) for preparing the patches.
