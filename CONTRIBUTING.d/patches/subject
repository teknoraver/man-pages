Name
	patches/subject - instructions for writing the subject of a patch

Description
	The subject is the first line of the patch description (i.e.,
	the commit message).

    File names
	Mention the name(s) of the file(s) being patched.  Write the
	full path.  When several files in a directory are modified,
	write the name of the directory, with a trailing '/'.  Example:

		[PATCH v1] man/man2/shmop.2: Add "(void *)" cast to RETURN VALUE

    English sentence
	The subject line after the file-name prefix should be a correct
	English sentence.  The only exception is that we omit the
	trailing period.  The sentence should start in upper case,
	unless it starts with a term that must go in lower case.

    Trivial subject
	For trivial patches, you can use subject tags:

		ffix	Formatting fix.
		tfix	Typo fix.
		wfix	Minor wording fix.
		srcfix	Change to manual page source that doesn't affect
			the output.

	Example:

		[PATCH v1] tcp.7: tfix

    [PATCH] prefix
	When sending the patch via email, the prefix "[PATCH]" should be
	prepended to the patch subject to form the "Subject:" header
	field of the email.  This prefix might include more information,
	such as the version of the patch: "[PATCH v1]".
