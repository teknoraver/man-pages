Description
   Mailing list
       The main discussions regarding development of the project,
       patches, bugs, news, doubts, etc. happen on the mailing list.
       To send an email to the project, send it to Alejandro and CC the
       mailing list:

           To: Alejandro Colomar <alx@kernel.org>
           Cc: <linux-man@vger.kernel.org>

       Please CC any relevant developers and mailing lists that may know
       about or be interested in the discussion.  If your email
       discusses a feature or change, and you know which developers
       added the feature or made the change that your email discusses,
       please CC them on the email; with luck they may review and
       comment on it.  If you don't know who the developers are, you may
       be able to discover that information from mailing list archives
       or from git(1) logs or logs in other version control systems.
       Obviously, if you are the developer of the feature being
       discussed in a man-pages email, please identify yourself as such.
       Relevant mailing lists may include:

           Cc: LKML <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>
           Cc: Linux API <linux-api@vger.kernel.org>
           Cc: Glibc <libc-alpha@sourceware.org>

   Sign your emails with PGP
        We encourage that you sign all of your emails sent to the
        mailing list, (especially) including the ones containing
        patches, with your PGP key.  This helps establish trust between
        you and other contributors of this project, and prevent others
        impersonating you.  If you don't have a key, it's not mandatory
        to sign your email, but you're encouraged to create and start
        using a PGP key.  See also:

        There are many ways you can sign your patches, and it depends on
        your preferred tools.  You can use neomutt(1) (>= 20240201) as a
        driver for git-send-email(1).  In <~/.gitconfig>, add the
        following section:

            [sendemail]
                sendmailcmd = neomutt -C -H - && true
